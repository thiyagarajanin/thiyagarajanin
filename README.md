## Hi there! Thank you for dropin by 🙂

I’m a system admin, and this is my blog. I live in Tamilnadu, India. I love computers, driving,  playing and photography.

Planning to write something from my work experience about the techniques and “How To guides” as they might help others.

I also like to share some photos (Very few) that shot by me.

Feel free to write me your comments and thoughts.

Thanks again.

(Please don’t spam 🙂 )
